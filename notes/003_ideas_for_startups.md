## Notes

- Most people can't generate ideas is because they haven;t tried to generate them.
- People overvalue ideas.
- Startup ideas are not million dollar ideas.
- Most startup end up nothing like the initial idea.
- The initial idea is just a starting point-- not a blueprint, but a question.
- Idea is a blueprint, but the right blueprint.c
- For an idea to be wrong, is only partial solution.
- To generate a way to reduce the problem from thinking of a million dollar idea to thinking of a mistaking questions required:
    - to be familiar with promising new technologies
    - to have the right kind of friends
- Valuable ideas are very close to good ideas.
