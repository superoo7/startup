# Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas

[Link](http://paulgraham.com/bronze.html)

## Quote

- If you're going to spend years working on something, you'd think it might be wise to spend at least a couple days considering different ideas, instead of going with the first that comes into your head.
- So the biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect: you come up with a random idea, plunge into it, and then at each point (a day, a week, a month) feel you've put so much time into it that this must be the idea.
- Realize that having invested time in something doesn't make it good.
- Going into business is like a hang-glider launch: you'd better do it wholeheartedly, or not at all.
- That's the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work that's beneath them. Big companies try to hire the right person for the job. Startups win because they don'tâ€”because they take people so smart that they would in a big company be doing "research," and set them to work instead on problems of the most immediate and mundane sort. Think Einstein designing refrigerators.
