# Quote

- The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.
- It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself.
- Best startup ideas:
    - They're something the founders themselves want
    - They themselves can build
    - few others realize are worth doing
- the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.
- "made-up" or "sitcom" startup ideas: come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but was actually bad.
- Live in the future, then build what's missing.


# Questions

- Who wants this right now? 
- Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of?
